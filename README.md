## Course Description

This course covers the core concepts and skills required to secure a modern, cloud-native application. Join instructor and security engineer James Berthoty as he provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of application security posture management (ASPM) and how it integrates a variety of different security tools used to secure applications from supply chain and other threats. Explore the fundamentals of code security, container security, runtime security, and remediating findings. Along the way, test out your new skills in the exercise challenges at the end of each section. Upon completing this course, youâ€™ll be prepared to successfully argue for the value of different security tools in your development workflows, as well as implement a full program to operationalize those tools.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
